## Weather Study To-Do List   
     
### Questions                 
     
- [x] What are the locations available?
- [ ] How many locations can be queried in a single query?
- [ ] How often are forecasts revised?
- [ ] What is meant by `mode=daily_compact` in a query? (It does seem to change the results slightly.)

### To build                  

- [x] Construct query.
- [ ] Construct saved-file name: `item` + `date_time` + suffix.
- [ ] Construct protocol for preventing retrieved data from being revealed. Encryption? Or do we need to worry about this?
- [ ] Choose data to query and retain.
- [ ] Save returned results to file in standard format.
- [ ] Construct schema for storing data.
