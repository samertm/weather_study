To Whom It May Concern:

	We are interested in comparing predictions of temperature to actual observed temperature. On page http://www.nws.noaa.gov/ndfd/definitions.htm we see elements "maximum/minimum temperature" and "apparent temperature". Are we correct in thinking that these fields represent NOAA's *predictions* of actual and apparent temperature? Or should we be looking elsewhere for that data?
	
	Also, if that is correct, then can you tell us where we would find records of actual observed temperature at the same locations?
	
	Thanks very much for your time with this inquiry.
	
				Sincerely,
