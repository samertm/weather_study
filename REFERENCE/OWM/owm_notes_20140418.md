## Open Weather Map Notes 20140418

[edited 20140418]

1. Unclear how city list changes when downloaded on new day. Therefore have begun saving city_list_bytes for comparison, since normalized versions are identical.

1. Added "snow" material to SQL script.

1. Changed `utils.isolate_city_codes()` to convert latitude and longitude values to `float()` and the corresponding items in the SQL script to `NUMBER`.

1. Revised to-do list structure.

1. Downloads of US data: one at 7318 seconds.
