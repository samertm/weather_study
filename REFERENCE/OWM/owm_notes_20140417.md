## Open Weather Map Notes 20140417

[edited 20140417]

1. Merged `utils_gs20140415_rev0416.py` and `utils_gs20140415.py` into `utils.py`. Confirmed that everything works.

1. Began using `pydoc.writedoc()` to generate HTML summary of module.

1. Added `utils.find_snow_or_rain_0` and `utils.U.find_lowest_value`. Interesting results for rain, which seems to have a minimum value:

    ~~~
In [10]: U.find_lowest_value()
In directory ../DOWNLOADS/downloads_OWM_US_20140414-2215 the lowest value of rain is 0.2.
In directory ../DOWNLOADS/downloads_OWM_US_20140415-0915 the lowest value of rain is 0.2.
In directory ../DOWNLOADS/downloads_OWM_US_20140415-1225 the lowest value of rain is 0.2.
In directory ../DOWNLOADS/downloads_OWM_US_20140415-1628 the lowest value of rain is 0.2.
In directory ../DOWNLOADS/downloads_OWM_US_20140416-0059 the lowest value of rain is 0.2.
In directory ../DOWNLOADS/downloads_OWM_US_20140416-1829 the lowest value of rain is 0.2.
In directory ../DOWNLOADS/downloads_OWM_US_20140416-2235 the lowest value of rain is 0.2.

   and for snow, which does not:

    ~~~
In [13]: U.find_lowest_value('snow')
In directory ../DOWNLOADS/downloads_OWM_US_20140414-2215 the lowest value of snow is 0.
In directory ../DOWNLOADS/downloads_OWM_US_20140415-0915 the lowest value of snow is 0.25.
In directory ../DOWNLOADS/downloads_OWM_US_20140415-1225 the lowest value of snow is 0.
In directory ../DOWNLOADS/downloads_OWM_US_20140415-1628 the lowest value of snow is 0.01.
In directory ../DOWNLOADS/downloads_OWM_US_20140416-0059 the lowest value of snow is 0.5.
In directory ../DOWNLOADS/downloads_OWM_US_20140416-1829 the lowest value of snow is 0.08.
In directory ../DOWNLOADS/downloads_OWM_US_20140416-2235 the lowest value of snow is 0.01.

1. Cleaned up old debug-print statements from `retrieve_data_vals`.
