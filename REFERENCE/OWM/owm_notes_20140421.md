## OWM Notes 20140421

[edited 20140421]

1. Tasks I hope to get done today:
 
  2. Data insertion into db, from OWM (**DONE**). Needs some sort of verification, pending creation of a formal test suite.
 
  2. Function to store in (new) db table the name of each download set that is inserted. With this, we can keep track locally of what the local database contains. (**DONE**)
 
  2. Right now the download files are undergoing compression and deletion immediately at the end of the download process, so it will be necessary to do all data-related steps with a compressed file â€” opening it for the purpose of retrieving the data. That would happen locally, Ao that we don't have to upload the whole db.
 
  2. Function to retrieve data from db.
 
  2. And of course before we can start doing actual analysis of forecasts, we'll need observation data, too.

1. Summary of work done:

  Today we got the function written and working to enter forecast values into the database. We also added functionality so that we know whether a given downloaded dataset has already been added or not, and we can choose to re-add it or not at the time the function is run.


  Today's NOAA downloads are complete:

        downloads_NOAA_US_20140421-1745_to_1751.tar.bz2
        downloads_NOAA_200_cities_20140421-1745.tar.bz2

  and the day's OWM download was under way when DPB left the space.

1. Next: add code to retrieve data from the database, and look into getting observed data.
