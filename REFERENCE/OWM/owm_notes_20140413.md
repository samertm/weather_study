## Open Weather Map Notes

[edited 20140413]

1. Existing Python resource: https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm.

> PyOWM is a client Python wrapper library for the OpenWeatherMap (OWM) web API.>
> PyOWM runs on Python 2.7, 3.2 and 3.3

Seems to be well documented.

1. Attempting to search multiple location-IDs at once returns only the first of them:

    http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?id=2643743,6058560

returns data for 2643743 but none for 6058560.

1. Appending `&cnt=14` to API call retrieves 14 days of forecast content. But the content is almost identical without `cnt` entry or with `&cnt=0`.

1. List of cities found at http://openweathermap.org/help/city_list.txt. Code written to keep a copy of this, with hash, so that changes can be identified quickly.

1. For bulk data, can we using `bbox` (bounding box find)? http://bugs.openweathermap.org/projects/api/wiki/Api_2_5/6. Don't understand the five parameters used:

    bbox=12,32,15,37,10

perhaps means longitude in reange 12-14, latitude in range 32-37, and a total of 10 points? Need more data.

1. `utils.construct_OWM_api_req()` now working: appid must go last in query. Using

        http://openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/city?...

we only get five days of forecast, at three-hour intervals, regardless of what `cnt` parameters we use. But using

        http://openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily?...

we get as many days as we request, up to 16(!). Within Ipython, using

        import utils as U
        U.construct_OWM_api_req(count=16)['list']

1. The decoded JSON object is a dict, whose key 'list' is a list containing most of the content.

1. List of the main description parameters: http://bugs.openweathermap.org/projects/api/wiki/Weather_Data.

1. What does `'cod': '200'` mean in results? Not the Weather Condition Codes (http://bugs.openweathermap.org/projects/api/wiki/Weather_Condition_Codes), which are given at `weather.id`.

1. Added `convert_from_unixtime()` fn to utils. One day is a difference of 86400 in Unix time.

1. There are slight differences in the daily forecast results with and without `&mode=daily_compact` in the query.
