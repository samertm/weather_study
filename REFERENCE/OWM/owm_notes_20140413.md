## Open Weather Map Notes

[edited 20140413]

1. Existing Python resource: https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm.

> PyOWM is a client Python wrapper library for the OpenWeatherMap (OWM) web API.>
> PyOWM runs on Python 2.7, 3.2 and 3.3

Seems to be well documented.

1. Attempting to search multiple location-IDs at once returns only the first of them:

    http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?id=2643743,6058560

returns data for 2643743 but none for 6058560.

1. Appending `&cnt=14` to API call retrieves 14 days of forecast content. But the content is almost identical without `cnt` entry or with `&cnt=0`.

1. List of cities found at http://openweathermap.org/help/city_list.txt. Code written to keep a copy of this, with hash, so that changes can be identified quickly.

1. For bulk data, can we using `bbox` (bounding box find)? http://bugs.openweathermap.org/projects/api/wiki/Api_2_5/6. Don't understand the five parameters used:

    bbox=12,32,15,37,10

perhaps means longitude in reange 12-14, latitude in range 32-37, and a total of 10 points? Need more data.

1. `utils.construct_OWM_api_req()` now working: appid must go last in query. I do not see 14 days of forecast — only to `'dt_txt': '2014-04-18 00:00:00'` when made on 2014-04-13. In fact, the `count` variable does not seem to make much difference in the data returned — the same number of days are being reported.

1. The decoded JSON object is a dict, whose key 'list' is a list containing most of the content.

1. List of the main description parameters: http://bugs.openweathermap.org/projects/api/wiki/Weather_Data.
