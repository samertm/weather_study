## Open Weather Map Notes

[edited 20140413]

1. Existing Python resource: https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm.

> PyOWM is a client Python wrapper library for the OpenWeatherMap (OWM) web API.>
> PyOWM runs on Python 2.7, 3.2 and 3.3

Seems to be well documented.

1. Attempting to search multiple location-IDs at once returns only the first of them:

    http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?id=2643743,6058560

returns data for 2643743 but none for 6058560.

1. Appending `&cnt=14` to API call retrieves 14 days of forecast content. But the content is almost identical without `cnt` entry or with `&cnt=0`.

1. List of cities found at http://openweathermap.org/help/city_list.txt. Code written to keep a copy of this, with hash, so that changes can be identified quickly.
