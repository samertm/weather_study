## Open Weather Map Notes

[edited 20140415]

1. This morning the computer showed that the full run of 11731 US locations ran last night for 7891 seconds = about 2:10 hours, a rate of one site (downloaded and saved to disk) of about 1.5 seconds per location. It ran from 22:15 to 00:27. No files are smaller than 4K; all appear to be filled with JSON data and the expected number were received. A second run was begun this morning at 9:15 a.m.

1. Next goals are 

  2. to decide how to visualize the data and 
  2. to begin preparing to store the data in the database and archive it afterwards.

1. Can use `ast.literal_eval()` to evaluate dictionaries stored as text in text files. This enables us to avoid the dangerous `eval()` function. If the content of the file is a dictionary, it should work correctly:

        In [15]: s = '{"a": "b"}'
        
        In [16]: eval(s)
        Out[16]: {'a': 'b'}
        
        In [17]: ast.literal_eval(s)
        Out[17]: {'a': 'b'}
        
        In [18]: type(eval(s))
        Out[18]: dict
        
        In [19]: type(ast.literal_eval(s))
        Out[19]: dict

1. Added code to `utils.make_urlrequest()` so that HTTP errors report the actual URL being attempted.
