## Open Weather Map Notes

[edited 20140415]

1. This morning the computer showed that the full run of 11731 US locations ran last night for 7891 seconds = about 2:10 hours, a rate of one site (downloaded and saved to disk) of about 1.5 seconds per location. It ran from 22:15 to 00:27. No files are smaller than 4K; all appear to be filled with JSON data and the expected number were received. A second run was begun this morning at 9:15 a.m.

1. Next goals are 

  2. to decide how to visualize the data and 
  2. to begin preparing to store the data in the database and archive it afterwards.
