## NDFD Notes 20140420

[edited 20140420]

1. API queries composed and coded for two NOAA services: a list of 200 cities and the c. 11K points we have from OWM.

1. Both queries now compress and delete the original downloads, saving space. 

1. Since NOAA supplies only very short-term forecasts for rain and snow, I have more confidence that they have confidence in the values they are supplying.
