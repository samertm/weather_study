### Working on Weather Underground

1. Planning thoughts sent by DPB to GS:

> As for the central question of how we share a database, I have these thoughts:
> 
>     A. We can both keep a copy of the database on our local computers; my 
>     machine-wide `.gitignore` file excludes `.db` files from being pushed to 
>     the repository in any case. We would update our copies of the database 
>     separately, but we could share retrieved data and all code.
>
>     B. The real question is how to share retrieved data, since we're perhaps 
>     not supposed to let our repo serve as a data source for other users â€” were 
>     we to do so, we would then be redistributing the data, something I think 
>     we're not supposed to do. As I read Section 3 "Conditions & Restrictions", 
>     Subsection (d), of the Terms and Conditions 
>     (http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/terms.html), that is forbidden: 
>
>>     "You will not resell, sublicense, redistribute or provide access to the 
>>     API to any third party, including, without limitation, by incorporating 
>>     API access into chipsets of any kind."
>
>     C. Instead, I see the following options:
>
>         i. We could store the data in a private repository and each insert it 
>         into the db on our separate instances running on own machines. GitHub 
>         charges for that, but Bitbucket does not. We could keep everything 
>         except the data on GitHub. That would be simplest.
>
>         ii. We could set up a server somewhere else on which to store the data 
>         and the database. However, the problem of backing it up to a 
>         repository is not really resolved by this solution.
>
>         iii. We could store the data publicly but in encrypted form in the 
>         repo, using a tool such as PyCrypto 
>         (https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/) or one of the many 
>         competitors available through `pip`. That would be less simple but it 
>         would give us exposure to an additional tool of interest.
>
>         iv. We could each set up `cron` jobs to download the data on our own 
>         system. That seems to me inefficient and not worth considering for 
>         now.

1. Created To-do list using [GitHub-Flavored Markdown](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments): https://gist.github.com/brannerchinese/10594788. This apparently can only be done using a Gist or other peripheral file type.

1. Another way to avoid restrictions on the data is to use an API other than Weather Underground. Other Weather APIs:

  2. Open Weather Map](http://openweathermap.org/API).
  2. [iGoogle Weather API [apparently shut down as of 2013](http://thenextweb.com/google/2012/08/28/did-google-just-quietly-kill-private-weather-api/).

### Working on Open Weather Map

1. Existing Python resource: https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm.

 > PyOWM is a client Python wrapper library for the OpenWeatherMap (OWM) web API.>
 > PyOWM runs on Python 2.7, 3.2 and 3.3

 Seems to be well documented.

1. Attempting to search multiple location-IDs at once returns only the first of them:

    http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?id=2643743,6058560

  returns data for 2643743 but none for 6058560.

1. Appending `&cnt=14` to API call retrieves 14 days of forecast content. But the content is almost identical without `cnt` entry or with `&cnt=0`.

1. List of cities found at http://openweathermap.org/help/city_list.txt. Code written to keep a copy of this, with hash, so that changes can be identified quickly.

1. For bulk data, can we using `bbox` (bounding box find)? http://bugs.openweathermap.org/projects/api/wiki/Api_2_5/6. Don't understand the five parameters used:

        bbox=12,32,15,37,10

  perhaps means longitude in range 12-14, latitude in range 32-37, and a total of 10 points? Need more data.

1. `utils.construct_OWM_api_req()` now working: appid must go last in query. Using

        http://openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/city?...

  we only get five days of forecast, at three-hour intervals, regardless of what `cnt` parameters we use. But using

        http://openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily?...

  we get as many days as we request, up to 16(!). Within Ipython, using

        import utils as U
        U.construct_OWM_api_req(count=16)['list']

1. The decoded JSON object is a dict, whose key 'list' is a list containing most of the content.

1. List of the main description parameters: http://bugs.openweathermap.org/projects/api/wiki/Weather_Data.

1. What does `'cod': '200'` mean in results? Not the Weather Condition Codes (http://bugs.openweathermap.org/projects/api/wiki/Weather_Condition_Codes), which are given at `weather.id`.

1. Added `convert_from_unixtime()` fn to utils. One day is a difference of 86400 in Unix time, the number of seconds.

1. There are slight differences in the daily forecast results with and without `&mode=daily_compact` in the query. **Update 20140423**: No idea yet what this means.
