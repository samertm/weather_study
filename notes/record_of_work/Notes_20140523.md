## Record of work, 20140523

 1. Cron jobs now working on Ubuntu server; these will run every day at 16:30 and errors will be logged to `logs`. Works.
 1. In order to run cron jobs on `master`, we had to merge `CODE/` on `branch dev_dpb` with `master`. So `master` is now up to date as to most content on `dev_dpb`.
 1. Made changes to `utils` and `request` to trap for `null` in download file.
 1. Made new change to shell script; Git perhaps needs full path of directory affected by `add`.
