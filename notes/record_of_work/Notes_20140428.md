### Working on Open Weather Map data

 1. MatPlotLib save-to-file `savefig()` working on DPB's machine. Repaired MatPlotLib installation problems on Gina's machine. MatPlotLib v. 1.4.x had to be installed from GitHub rather than pip. `GEOS` later had to be reinstalled on DPB's machine.
 1. One map now generated per slide, with smaller color bar. Filenames derived from plot parameters.
 1. Code refactored to avoid assigning `pyplot` method calls to unused variables.
 1. Added `to_print=True` default argument to both `retrieve.py` functions to suppress verbose timing information. Change also made to `retrieve.get_single_date_data_from_db()` call in `map_us_dpb.py`.
 1. Added `#! /usr/bin/env python` line to `map_us_dpb.py`.
