## Record of work, 20140512

 1. Revised `retrieve.get_single_date_data_from_db` for `output='GeoJSON'`, following the uneconomical model at http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html. In detail:

   The datatype returned is a dictionary, containing the two items

        'type': 'FeatureCollection',
        'features': <list of sub-dictionaries>

   Each of those sub-dictionaries has three items:

        'type': 'Feature',
        'geometry': <sub-sub-dictionary>
        'properties': <sub-sub-dictionary>

   The sub-sub-dictionary in `'geometry'` has two elements:

        'type': 'Point',
        'coordinates': [<lat>, <lon>]

   and the sub-sub-dictionary in `'properties'` has sixty elements:

        'maxt_0': item[2],
        'mint_0': item[3],
        'rain_0': item[4],
        'snow_0': item[5],
        'maxt_1': item[6],
        'mint_1': item[7],
        'rain_1': item[8],
        'snow_1': item[9],
        <etc., in all fifteen sets of four items each>

   That seems to match the description of a GeoJSON feature collection in http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html, except that I've left the underscores in the key-names, for ease of reading.

   This is a profound violation of Pythonic aesthetics, but I see that geodesy is still in a Fortran-era model of array-formatting, so let's keep it that way. I could have written the code for this more densely than I did, but it's easier to debug this way.

   Python dictionaries are not ordered, so the keys in the last-mentioned sub-sub-dictionary will come out in no comprehensible order. Here is what recent test output looked like:

        {"geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [34.46426, -93.133789]}, 
        "type": "Feature", "properties": {"rain_12": null, "mint_14": null, 
        "rain_1": 4, "maxt_12": null, "rain_11": null, "maxt_10": null, 
        "mint_7": 17.31, "maxt_3": 20.46, "snow_6": 0, "rain_9": null, 
        "maxt_1": 20.46, "mint_10": null, "maxt_11": null, "mint_1": 12.98, 
        "mint_9": null, "rain_0": 0, "rain_5": 7.5, "snow_11": null, 
        "mint_0": 16.34, "snow_1": 0, "mint_6": 10.08, "rain_3": 4, 
        "maxt_9": null, "rain_13": null, "maxt_14": null, "snow_10": null, 
        "mint_4": 16.73, "maxt_0": 29.13, "snow_9": null, "snow_12": null, 
        "maxt_4": 23.35, "mint_2": 15.12, "rain_2": 0, "snow_7": 0, 
        "maxt_13": null, "snow_14": null, "rain_6": 0, "rain_10": null, 
        "rain_8": 0.46, "snow_4": 0, "mint_13": null, "snow_2": 0, 
        "maxt_7": 23.13, "rain_4": 3.7, "rain_7": 15.63, "snow_0": 0, 
        "snow_13": null, "maxt_2": 23.14, "mint_11": null, "maxt_6": 25.08, 
        "mint_8": 16.82, "rain_14": null, "snow_8": 0, "mint_3": 12.98, 
        "mint_5": 16.96, "maxt_5": 21.92, "mint_12": null, "snow_5": 0, 
        "snow_3": 0, "maxt_8": 25.05}}

   We call this with retrieve.get_single_date_data_from_db(exact_date, output='GeoJSON'). If in addition you pass none_values=True, you'll get the dictionary I described earlier that tells you what type of data we have `None` for.

 1. For readability, have moved the four functions actually creating the various JSON or other objects into separate functions. The main `get_single_date_data_from_db()` function is now much clearer.
