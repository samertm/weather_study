## OWM Notes 20140424

[edited 20140425]

1. Edited `install_netCDF4.md` and updated `requirements` file.
1. Created `install_matplotlib_basemap.md` file.
1. Added and tested `utils.untar_directory()`. This is now built into `populate_db.process_dir_of_downloads` so that all extracted files exist only transiently in `DATA/TEMPORARY/ `.
1. Generated plots superimposed on map of U.S.
1. Found workaround for MatPlotLib `savefig` error.
1. Completed presentation for Hacker School Thursday presentations.
