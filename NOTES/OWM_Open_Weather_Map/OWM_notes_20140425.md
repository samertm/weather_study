## OWM Notes 20140425

[edited 20140425]

1. Tracked down reason for error in which downloads of city list on different days were identical even though hash function showed them to be different. The issue: Python built-in hash function is **randomly seeded** after v. 3.3. Write-up at http://dpb.bitbucket.org/unexpected-behavior-from-the-python-3-built-in-hash-function.html. When a hash value is to be used across different runs of Python, the fastest way to fix this is to replaced `hash()` with `md5` or similar standard hash function. Revised `city_codes.py` to correct this problem and tested it.
