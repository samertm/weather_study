1. Tracked down reason for error in which downloads of city list on different days were identical even though hash function showed them to be different. Python built-in hash function is randomly seeded after v. 3.3. Write-up at http://dpb.bitbucket.org/unexpected-behavior-from-the-python-3-built-in-hash-function.html. `hash()` should be replaced with `md5` or similar standard hash function for fastest correction.
