## OWM Notes 20140430

[edited 20140430]

 1. Found unexplained JSON error in download #8024 or #8025 last night and the program stopped running. Have added code to survive errors of that kind — will simply pass the downloaded content as a string, rather than JSON if the error happens five times — but in any case we've lost the remaining 3K downloads for that session.
 1. Added function `retrieve.get_single_date_data_from_db_json()` to supply JSON output. Read the comments to see a description of the output's multiply nested dictionary structure. Output is JSON as default; pass `JSONize=False` to get the output as the raw dictionary. Those values that are sub-subdictionaries consisting of `{'mint': None, 'rain': None, 'maxt': None, 'snow': None}` are further rendered simply as `None` alone, using an `if-then` clause.
 1. Similarly, replaced output tuples `(None, None, None, None)` with `None` in function `retrieve.get_single_date_data_from_db`. Tested and works.
 1. Added default argument to `utils.tar_directory` so that NOAA downloads can be saved automatically to `COMPRESSED_BUT_KEPT_FOR_STUDY_AND_NOT_IN_USE/` after compression. Tested and works.
