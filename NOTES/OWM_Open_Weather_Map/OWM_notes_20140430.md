## OWM Notes 20140430

[edited 20140430]

 1. Found unexplained JSON error in download #8024 or #8025 last night and the program stopped running. Have added code to survive errors of that kind — will simply pass the downloaded content as a string, rather than JSON if the error happens five times — but in any case we've lost the remaining 3K downloads for that session.
