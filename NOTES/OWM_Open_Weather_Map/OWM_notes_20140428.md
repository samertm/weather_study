## OWM Notes 20140428

 1. MatPlotLib save-to-file `savefig()` working on DPB's machine. Repaired MatPlotLib installation problems on Gina's machine. MatPlotLib v. 1.4.x had to be installed from GitHub rather than pip.
 1. One map now generated per slide, with smaller color bar. Filenames derived from plot parameters.
 1. Code refactored to avoid assigning `pyplot` method calls to unused variables.
