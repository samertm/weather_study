## Record of work, 20140519

 1. Added logging to `requests` (tested in `make_urlrequest()`, one of three `try` blocks in this module).
 1. Added logging to `city_codes` (not yet tested, but also calls `requests.make_urlrequest()`, already tested).
 2. `requests` now has `main()` which can be called from command line; this will aid setting up `cron` jobs soon.
