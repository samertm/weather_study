### Working on Open Weather Map data

 1. Refactored `map_us.py` as `map_us_dpb_comprehensions.py`, with list comprehensions replacing several long blocks of lists and with dictionary branching replacing a long `if-else` block.
 1. Much time expent studying how to create a class using MatPlotLib.PyPlot, but no resolution. Question finally posted to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23371081/matplotlib-are-there-actual-pyplot-objects-that-interact-with-basemap-objects.
 1. Histogram content basically working, though not pretty. Added to working `map_us.py` (version using comprehensions).
 1. Comprehension version of `map_us.py` now renamed `map_us.py`; various older versions moved to `/OLD`.
 1. MatPlotLib to be abandoned â€” work now beginning on JavaScript version.
