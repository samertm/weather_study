### Working on Open Weather Map data

 1. `query_date` changed to int in `utils` and `create_weather_OWM_db.sql`, so that SQL can ask for ranges of dates.

 1. Wrote two functions to retrieve content from the database: one (in list form) for multiple dates; one (in dictionary form) for a single date.

 1. Filled out `README` for more precise utility.
