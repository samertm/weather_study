## Record of work, 20140520

 1. Separate logging instantiation into separate module.
 1. Add 30-second delay after loggable errors; some of these occasionally turn out to repeat incessantly, leading to bloated log content.
 1. Add code to incorporate today's date into log filename.
 1. At end, if log is empty, delete.
 1. Decided that no modules other than `requests.py` actually need logging; left it in `city_codes.py` since that may eventually be run as part of automated downloading. The other modules will always be run manually and don't need logging.
 1. Similarly, only `requests` is likely to need to have a cron job and so only it requires a `main()` function.
