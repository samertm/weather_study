## Record of work

 1. Created DigitalOcean instance; set up Ubuntu v. 14.04, cloned Weather Study repo, and installed necessary packages. Much time spent trying to get MatPlotLib and Basemap installed and working; eventually discarded instance and started afresh, trying Anaconda installation (via Microconda to get pure Python3.3 installation). Snapshot created at end of day, before trying any code or populating database.
