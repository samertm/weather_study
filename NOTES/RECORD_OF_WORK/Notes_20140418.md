### Working on Open Weather Map data

1. Unclear how city list changes when downloaded on new day. Therefore have begun saving city_list_bytes for comparison, since normalized versions are identical.

1. Added "snow" material to SQL script.

1. Changed `utils.isolate_city_codes()` to convert latitude and longitude values to `float()` and the corresponding items in the SQL script to `NUMBER`.

1. Revised to-do list structure.

1. Separated four functions out into `check_data.py`.

1. Downloads of US data: 

 2. One at 7318 seconds; another at 7052 seconds. (20140418-1531, 20140418-1813)
 2. Three more, 15 minutes apart, at 7040, 7003, and 6985 seconds each. (20140418-2031, 20140418-2046, 20140418-2101)
 2. Three more, attempting 1 minute apart, at 6797, 6786, and 6764 seconds each. But the second two (20140418-2332) seem to have begun in the same clock minute, so I suppose their output was mixed in a single directory. The first was 20140418-2331.
 2. Two more, 1 minute apart, at 7070 and 7035 seconds each. (20140419-1246, 20140419-1247)
 2. Two more, 1 minute apart, at 7518 and 7503 seconds each. (20140419-1547, 20140419-1548)
