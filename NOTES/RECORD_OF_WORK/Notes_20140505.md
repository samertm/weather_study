## Record of work, 20140505

### Working on Open Weather Map data

 1. Consolidated remaining notes to "Record of work" model â€” single stream of notes per day.
 1. Posted query to DigitalOcean community about Numpy installation problems and another about how long snapshot creation has taken.
 1. Norm Kabir suggests working in Python 2.7 rather than Python 3. He cites:

   > Exploring the needs and drivers of these three groups paints a pretty
dim picture for Py3k in the scientific world. Individuals have no
pressure to switch, and collaborations become so entrenched that
switching is near impossible. Even those who are actively contributing
to the Numpy and Scipy codebases cannot use Python 3 for this task,
and thus have no big driver for change.
