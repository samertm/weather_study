## NDFD Notes 20140416

[edited 20140423]

1. Learned from NOAA that historical forecast records are served at SRRS.

  2. GUI: http://has.ncdc.noaa.gov/pls/plhas/HAS.FileAppSelect?datasetname=9957ANX
  2. SRRS documentation: http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/documentlibrary/tddoc/td9949.pdf
  2. SRRS resource description: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/documentlibrary/surface-doc.html#9957

   Our NOAA contact, asked about API availability, says:
   
   > There is none.  This data is usually requested by customers looking for a specific date or two for forecasts or watches/warnings issued or by the NWS for plane craft accident data.
   
   We will see if using the Web-GUI we can't construct our own API-calls.

1. Information from Andrea Fey about NOAA's Nomad and THREDD/LAS materials, as well as about weather forecasting models. We will defer studying these for now, however.

  2. Nomads: nomads.ncdc.noaa.gov
  2. Thredds: http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/thredds/index.jsp
