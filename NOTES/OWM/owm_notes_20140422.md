## OWM Notes 20140422

[edited 20140422]

1. History API: http://bugs.openweathermap.org/projects/api/wiki/Api_2_5_history

  2. Using http://openweathermap.org/data/2.5/history/city/?id=5106292&type=day&units=metric&APPID=<API-key> brings up records like this running back about a day (`"cnt":23`):

        ~~~
"list":[
 {"main":{"temp":282.24,"humidity":40,"pressure":1022,"temp_min":278.15,"temp_max":284.82},
  "wind":{"speed":0.51,"gust":2.57,"deg":47},
  "clouds":{"all":0},
  "weather":[{"id":800,"main":"Clear","description":"Sky is Clear","icon":"01d"}],
  "dt":1398087314}
...]
        ~~~

    It looks as though the temperature is in Kelvin (despite our requesting metric) and the period is the hour (despite our requesting day)

  2. The page http://bugs.openweathermap.org/projects/api/wiki/Api_2_5_history shows more useful results for weather stations rather than cities, but the examples there do not seem to work. 
  2. We intend at the moment to concentrate only on the trends within forecast data rather than the relationship between the forecasts and the observation.
