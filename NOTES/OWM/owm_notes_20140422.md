## OWM Notes 20140422

[edited 20140422]

1. Added default argument `limit` to `full_forecast_download_OWM()` and `request_all_NOAA_points()` to allow short downloads for testing purposes. Tested and working.

1. In pursuit of weather observation data, see the history API: http://bugs.openweathermap.org/projects/api/wiki/Api_2_5_history

  2. Using http://openweathermap.org/data/2.5/history/city/?id=5106292&type=day&units=metric&APPID=[API-key] brings up records like this running back about a day (`"cnt":23`):

        ~~~
"list":[
 {"main":{"temp":282.24,"humidity":40,"pressure":1022,"temp_min":278.15,"temp_max":284.82},
  "wind":{"speed":0.51,"gust":2.57,"deg":47},
  "clouds":{"all":0},
  "weather":[{"id":800,"main":"Clear","description":"Sky is Clear","icon":"01d"}],
  "dt":1398087314}
...]
        ~~~

     It looks as though the temperature is in Kelvin (despite our requesting metric) and the period is the hour (despite our requesting by the day). And I don't see how to go further back than 24 hours. So this doesn't seem very useful.

  2. The page http://bugs.openweathermap.org/projects/api/wiki/Api_2_5_history shows more useful results for weather stations rather than cities, but the examples there do not seem to work. 
  2. We can get current weather with, for instance, http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?id=2172797&units=metric&APPID=[API-key] but not historical
  2. We intend at the moment to concentrate only on the trends within forecast data rather than the relationship between the forecasts and the observation.

1. Moved those functions related to API-requests out of `utils.py` and into new module `requests.py`.

1. Rename actual downloading functions in `requests.py` for clarity.

1. Added much content to `README.md` describing installation and initial set-up. All content described there as of 20140422-1600 works as described.
