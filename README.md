## Weather Study

**Examination of bulk weather predictions and their accuracy.**

This project is still under development and may look somewhat disorganized.

---

Forecasters predict the weather many days in advance for any given location. Those predictions typically change as the target date approaches. 

Questions:

 * Can we make statistical generalizations about how those predictions change, and about the different kinds of locations for which predictions display different patterns of change?
 * In what useful ways can we map these patterns or otherwise display them graphically?
