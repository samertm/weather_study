## Record of work, 20140504

### Working on Open Weather Map data

 1. Moving to external server to allow use of `wemux` for real pairing.

   2. Created DigitalOcean instance; set up Ubuntu v. 14.04, cloned Weather Study repo, and installed necessary packages.
   2. Much time spent trying to get MatPlotLib and Basemap installed and working; the main problem was getting NumPy working. 
   2. Eventually discarded instance and started afresh, trying Anaconda installation (via Microconda3).
   2. Snapshot created at end of day, before trying any code or populating database. Next morning, no indication of when it finished — start-time seems to be recorded as GMT.
 1. NumPy installation was only possible after:

        sudo apt-get install build-essential gfortran libatlas-base-dev libatlas3gf-base libjpeg-dev libxml2-dev libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev

   And then overcoming permissions errors using

        sudo pip3 install numpy

   Even then, it was only accessible to `ipython` using `sudo ipython` — it does not seem to have been installed into the virtualenv environment itself (because of the use of `sudo`).
